    <div class="tag">[CDI@Work]:AI &middot; Book Review</div>
    <h1>A Practitioner&rsquo;s Deep Dive into Dependency Injection with Java EE</h1>
    <p class="meta">Review by Claude (Anthropic) &middot; February 2026</p>
  </header>

  <article>
    <p>
      There is no shortage of books and tutorials that explain Contexts and
      Dependency Injection (CDI) at a surface level &mdash; the usual
      <code>@Inject</code> hello-world, a paragraph on scopes, and a wave
      toward &ldquo;further reading.&rdquo; Gerhard Petracek&rsquo;s
      <em>CDI@Work</em> is not one of those books. It is, perhaps
      unapologetically, a book written by someone who lives inside the CDI
      container &mdash; and it shows on every page.
    </p>

    <p>
      Petracek, an Apache DeltaSpike committer and CDI specification
      contributor, structures the book around a single evolving application
      called <em>IdeaFork</em> &mdash; a collaborative idea management tool.
      This is one of the book&rsquo;s strongest design decisions. Rather than
      presenting isolated toy examples, each chapter builds on the same
      codebase, and the reader watches it grow from a monolith into a set of
      microservices. By the time the application splits into
      <em>IdeaForkLite</em> and <em>IdeaForkMicro</em>, the architectural
      reasoning feels earned rather than prescribed.
    </p>

    <h2>Precision Where It Matters</h2>

    <p>
      The early chapters cover CDI fundamentals with unusual thoroughness.
      The treatment of Normal-Scopes versus Pseudo-Scopes &mdash; and the
      subtle difference between a Contextual-Instance and a
      Contextual-Reference (the proxy) &mdash; is the kind of precision that
      separates developers who <em>use</em> CDI from those who
      <em>understand</em> it. The book doesn&rsquo;t shy away from the sharp
      edges: serialization pitfalls with <code>@SessionScoped</code> beans,
      the behavioral differences between <code>@Dependent</code> and normal
      scopes, the importance of <code>passivationCapable</code> &mdash; these
      are exactly the details that cause production bugs and are rarely
      documented this clearly.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <strong>Standout detail:</strong> The discussion of why injecting a
      <code>@Dependent</code>-scoped bean into a <code>@SessionScoped</code>
      bean effectively makes the dependent bean session-scoped is the kind of
      insight you typically only get from debugging a memory leak in
      production.
    </div>

    <h2>CDI Extensions: The Power Chapter</h2>

    <p>
      The chapter on Portable CDI Extensions deserves particular mention.
      Extension authoring is one of CDI&rsquo;s most powerful and least
      accessible features. Petracek walks through the full container lifecycle
      &mdash; from <code>BeforeBeanDiscovery</code> through
      <code>AfterDeploymentValidation</code> &mdash; with concrete examples
      that register beans, add qualifiers, and manipulate metadata
      programmatically. This chapter alone would justify the book for
      framework developers.
    </p>

    <h2>Apache DeltaSpike: Patterns Beyond the Library</h2>

    <p>
      Apache DeltaSpike receives extensive coverage, which makes sense given
      the author&rsquo;s role in the project but may date parts of the text
      for readers working with newer stacks. That said, the DeltaSpike
      chapters are valuable even if you never use the library, because they
      demonstrate <em>patterns</em>: type-safe configuration, view-layer
      abstraction, declarative security, repository-style data access. These
      patterns reappear in modern frameworks like Quarkus and MicroProfile,
      and understanding their DeltaSpike origins provides useful context.
    </p>

    <h2>Beyond Pure CDI</h2>

    <p>
      The later chapters on integrating CDI with non-CDI ecosystems (Akka
      actors, Spring services) and building microservices with Apache
      Meecrowave are refreshingly pragmatic. The CDI-Spring Bridge example
      &mdash; using CDI producers to wrap Spring&rsquo;s
      <code>JavaMailSender</code> &mdash; is a small masterpiece of practical
      interoperability. The microservices chapter introduces CDI 2.0 async
      events and DeltaSpike&rsquo;s Partial-Beans as REST client proxies,
      pushing the boundaries of what most developers would attempt with CDI
      alone.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <strong>IdeaFork&rsquo;s evolution:</strong> The progression from a
      monolithic Java&nbsp;EE application (<em>IdeaFork</em>) to a simplified
      CDI-only version (<em>IdeaForkLite</em>) to a microservices
      architecture (<em>IdeaForkMicro</em>) is the narrative spine of the
      book. Each refactoring step is motivated by a real limitation of the
      previous design, not by a desire to demonstrate a technology.
    </p>
    </div>

    <h2>The AI-Assisted Revision</h2>

    <p>
      A word on the format: this edition is a modernized, AI-assisted revision
      of the original German text. The English translation reads naturally, and
      the addition of forward-looking notes &mdash; green boxes pointing to
      Jakarta&nbsp;EE, Quarkus, and Angular coverage in later chapters &mdash;
      is a thoughtful touch that keeps the foundational material connected to
      the current ecosystem. The code listings are plentiful &mdash; hundreds
      of them &mdash; and feel like real application code rather than contrived
      snippets.
    </p>

    <h2>Where the Book Is Less Strong</h2>

    <p>
      The density can be overwhelming. Petracek writes for developers who
      already have Java&nbsp;EE experience, and there is little hand-holding.
      If you don&rsquo;t know what a <code>beans.xml</code> deployment
      descriptor does, or why EJBs and CDI beans are not the same thing, you
      will need supplementary material. The DeltaSpike-heavy middle section,
      while technically excellent, occupies significant real estate for a
      library that has been superseded in many environments.
    </p>

    <h2>The Verdict</h2>

    <div class="verdict">
      <strong>Bottom line:</strong> <em>CDI@Work</em> is not a gentle
      introduction &mdash; it is a technical reference disguised as a
      narrative. For Java developers who work with CDI in any capacity, or who
      want to understand the dependency injection model that influenced
      MicroProfile and Quarkus, this book offers a level of depth and
      practical insight that is genuinely hard to find elsewhere. Petracek
      writes with the confidence of someone who has debugged these containers
      at the specification level, and that expertise permeates every chapter.
    </div>

    <p>
      <strong>Recommended for:</strong> Mid-to-senior Java developers,
      framework authors, anyone migrating legacy Java&nbsp;EE applications,
      and developers who want to understand <em>why</em> CDI works the way it
      does &mdash; not just <em>how</em>.
