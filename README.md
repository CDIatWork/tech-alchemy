# [CDI@Work]:AI

**CDI and Apache DeltaSpike for Java EE** — by Gerhard Petracek

---

This is the public web edition of *[CDI@Work]:AI*, a real book originally authored in LaTeX covering Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) for Java EE 6 with Apache DeltaSpike. It has been modernized into a responsive, self-contained HTML book and extended with new chapters covering the migration path to Jakarta EE, Quarkus, Angular, and cloud deployment.

> **Important:** The modernized HTML layout, the English translation, all content from Chapter 9 onward, the blog, training slides, and demo applications were **completely AI-generated using [Claude](https://claude.ai), without any manual post-review or post-edits**. The content may contain inaccuracies, mistranslations, or errors and should not be treated as a verified or authoritative reference. Use at your own risk.

## How It Was Made

1. The original LaTeX-generated website was given to Claude with a general prompt — no detailed design specs. Claude made its own design decisions to produce a modern, responsive, self-contained HTML book in German.
2. Claude translated the surrounding German prose into English, preserving all code examples in their original form.
3. Claude wrote the blog posts, training slides, and demo applications.
4. Claude extended the book with Chapters 9–14 covering Jakarta EE migration, Quarkus, Angular, testing, security, and cloud deployment.

No step involved manual editing or review of the output.
